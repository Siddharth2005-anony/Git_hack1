Weather prediction using Naive-Bayes classifier

1. Weather Prediction using Naive Bayes Classifier
This project showcases how to build a simple yet powerful Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using Python’s scikit-learn library.
While the underlying dataset (with features like Age and Estimated Salary) often comes from a social network example, the workflow here is designed to simulate how you might predict weather conditions based on different atmospheric parameters.

2. Project Overview
This project walks you through the complete machine learning workflow for a classification problem:

*Data Preprocessing – Load and prepare the dataset by selecting and cleaning relevant columns.

*Feature Scaling – Standardize data features to improve learning performance.

*Model Training – Train the Gaussian Naive Bayes model on the processed data.

*Prediction & Evaluation – Use the trained model to make predictions and evaluate them using a Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Score.

*Visualization – Plot the decision boundary to clearly see how the model separates the classes.


3. Installation
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the code:

bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
